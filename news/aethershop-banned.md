# AetherShop Banned in SPSTLand

After the online shopping platform posted an advertisement using CGI to mock Singto, Silver, Rainbow and Tao, *mee* Company and TAO Company agreed to ban AetherShop services in the kingdom of Supersingtoland. The following are new rules, effective 10 May 2022 and onwards:

1\. Supersingto cizitens are prohibited from buying products through the AetherShop platform.

2\. If you really need to use the platform, please contact the Supersingto office to receive a temporary permit (only lasts for three Supersingto days), then enter your permit ID into the application. When your package is ready, please get your package at the following towns:<br><br>
    - Rainbow Town (RNB)<br>
    - Wongwai Town* (WNG)<br>
    - Fast Town* (FST)<br>
    - Tissue Town (TSU)<br>
    - Paper Town (PPR)<br>
    - Tonmai Town (TNM)<br>
    - Sunny Town (SUN)<br>
    - Wairai Town<sup>#</sup> (WRI)

<sub><i>*You will move fast when crossing the Singto-Wongwai border. Please take caution when entering Wongwai, as you may not be able to stop yourself. We do not take any responsibility for any damage caused by this.</i></sub>

<sub><i><sup>#</sup>Only available at the Supersingto embassy of Wairai Town, next to the Singto-Wairai border. Please take caution when entering Wairai. We do not take any responsibility for any damage caused by this.</i></sub>

3\. Please note that those who have a power level of over 10,000 in any form can use the AetherShop application freely without having to abide by these rules. You will still need to receieve a special permanent permit for using the platform at the Supersingto office. For safety, it is still highly recommended to receive your packages at the Supersingto Embassy of Wongwai Town or the Supersingto Embassy of Rainbow Town.

4\. If you violate these rules, you will receive a fine of 10,000,000 (ten million) Singtoland dollars and will be banished from Supersingtoland for a time frame of 10 (ten) Supersingto days.

5\. All cargo planes of the AetherShop brand will be shot down immediately if found flying into Supersingto airspace.

This is to protect the Supersingto VIPs and citizens, and we hope you can understand.

Regards,<br>
Singto Naraak<br>
King of Supersingtoland
